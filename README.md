# mft-presidential-debates
For a paper for one of my humanities classes, *Moral Psychology and Religion*, I'm tracking how [Jonathon Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com)'s [Moral Foundations Theory](https://moralfoundations.org) appears in the history of presidential debates.

Unofficial debate transcripts are provided by [The Commission on Presidential Debates](https://www.debates.org). The 2024 Harris-Trump debate transcript is provided by [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542).

This project scrapes debates for moral foundation word frequency in debates.

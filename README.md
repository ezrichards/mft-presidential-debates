The Moral Foundations dictionary (`dictionary.txt` in the folder structure) comes directly from the [Moral Foundations site](https://moralfoundations.org/wp-content/uploads/files/downloads/moral%20foundations%20dictionary.dic). This file includes potentially derogatory, strong, outdated or otherwise inappropriate language that does not represent my beliefs and is used here solely for scientific purposes.
